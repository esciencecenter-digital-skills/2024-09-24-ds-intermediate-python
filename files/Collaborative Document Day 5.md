## 🙋Getting help
### In the main room
To ask a question, raise your hand in zoom. Click on the icon labeled "Reactions" in the toolbar on the bottom center of your screen, then click the button 'Raise Hand ✋'. For urgent questions, just unmute and speak up!

You can also ask questions or type 'I need help' in the chat window and helpers will try to help you. Please note it is not necessary to monitor the chat - the helpers will make sure that relevant questions are addressed in a plenary way. (By the way, off-topic questions will still be answered in the chat)

### In the breakout room
If you click Ask for Help, it will notify the meeting host that you need assistance and they will be asked to join your breakout room.

Click Ask for Help  in the meeting controls.
Confirm that you would like assistance by clicking Invite Host.

## 🎓 Certificate of attendance
If you attend the full workshop you can request a certificate of attendance by emailing to training@esciencecenter.nl.
Please request your certificate within 8 months after the workshop, as we will delete all personal identifyable information after this period.

## :snowflake: Icebreaker
1. What is your way to manage your daily tasks (this can be at work or private). It's also fine if you do not have such a system :)
2. Thinking back about what you learned last time. What are things that were useful? What were things you learned that are overkill for your current work? What questions do you still have?
3. If you have any remaining questions, please 'Call for help'

## 🧠 Collaborative Notes

### Decide on your Group’s Repository

You all have your code repositories you have been working on throughout the course so far. For the upcoming exercise, groups will exchange repositories and review the code of the repository they inherit, and provide feedback.

1. Decide as a team on one of your repositories that will represent your group. You can do this any way you wish, but if you are having trouble then a pseudo-random number might help: 
`python -c "import numpy as np; print(np.random.randint(low=1, high=<size_group_plus_1>))"`
2. Add the URL of the repository to the section of the shared notes labelled ‘Decide on your Group’s Repository’, next to your team’s name.

| Nr. | Team Name             | Repository url                                                              | Team to assess... |

## 🗒 Optional exercises
Here follow some optional exercises for section 5 if you are done early or need some extra practice.
The exercises have an explorative nature, so feel free to go off in any direction that interests you.

### Exercise: Apply to your own project(s)
Apply what you learned in this section to your own project(s). 
This is the time to ask any questions to your instructors or helpers.
Everyone has different preferences for tooling, so getting the input of experienced developers is a great opportunity.

### Exercise: Issues
In your own project, examine your code for possible improvements and create issues for it.

### Exercise: Dependencies
Among the dependencies in your own project, assess one or two based on what you learned in this section (and in the rest of the workshop). Would you choose the same dependency again? Or would you choose alternatives, and if so, which ones?
