<h2 id="general">General Information</h2>

<p>The eScience Center offers a range of workshops and training courses, aimed at PhD candidates and other researchers or research software engineers. We organize workshops covering digital skills needed to put reproducible research into practice. These include online collaboration, reproducible code and good programming practices. We also offer more advanced workshops such as GPU Programming, Parallel Programming, Image Processing and Deep Learning.</p>

<p>This course aims to teach a core set of established, intermediate-level software development skills and 
best practices for working as part of a team in a research environment using Python as an example programming language.
The core set of skills we teach is a selective set of tried-and-tested collaborative development skills
that provides a firm foundation for continuing on your learning journey..</p>

<p>A typical learner for this course may be someone who is working in a research environment, needing to write some code, 
has gained basic software development skills either by self-learning or attending, e.g., a novice Software Carpentry Python course. 
They have been applying those skills in their domain of work by writing code for some time, e.g. half a year or more.
However, their software development-related projects are now becoming larger and are 
involving more researchers and other stakeholders (e.g. users), for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Software is becoming more complex and more collaborative development effort is needed to keep the software running</li>
  <li>Software is going further that just the small group developing and/or using the code - there are more users and an increasing need to add new features</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">‘Technical debt’</a> is increasing with demands to add new functionality while ensuring previous development efforts remain functional and maintainable</li>
</ul>

<p>They now need intermediate software engineering skills to help them design more robust software code that goes beyond a 
few thrown-together proof-of-concept scripts, taking into consideration the lifecycle of software, 
writing software for stakeholders, working in a team and applying a process to understanding, designing, building, releasing, 
and maintaining software.</p>

<div style="display: flex"><div>
     <strong>Who:&nbsp;</strong>
     </div>
     <div>
    <p><strong>This course is for you if:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>You have been writing software for a while, which may be used by people other than yourself, but it is currently undocumented or unstructured</li>
      <li>You want to learn:
        <ul>
          <li>more intermediate software engineering techniques and tools</li>
          <li>how to collaborate with others to develop software</li>
          <li>how to prepare software for others to use</li>

      </li>
      <li>You are currently comfortable with:
        <ul>
          <li>basic Python programming (though this may not be the main language you use) and applying it to your work on a regular basis</li>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
  To participate in
  
  this
  
  workshop,
  you will need access to software as described below.
  In addition, you will need an up-to-date web browser.
</p>
<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="software-setup">Software setup</h3>

<p>It is important that you setup everything on your laptop before the start of the course. This includes setting up a Command Line Tool, Git, a Python environment, and Integrated Development Environment.. Please follow <a href="https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/setup.html">these setup instructions</a>. Send us an email if you encounter any problems.</p>

<h3 id="videoconferencing">Install the videoconferencing client</h3>

<p>
  If you haven't used Zoom before, go to the
  <a href="https://zoom.us/download">official website</a>
  to download and install the Zoom client for your computer.
</p>

<h4>Set up your workspace</h4>

<p>
  Like other Carpentries workshops,
  you will be learning by "coding along" with the Instructors.
  To do this, you will need to have both the window for the tool
  you will be learning about (a terminal, RStudio, your web browser, etc..)
  and the window for the Zoom video conference client open.
  In order to see both at once,
  we recommend using one of the following set up options:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Two monitors:</strong> If you have two monitors,
      plan to have the tool you are learing up on one monitor and
      the video conferencing software on the other.</li>
    <li><strong>Two devices:</strong> If you don't have two monitors,
      do you have another device (tablet, smartphone) with a medium to large
      sized screen? If so, try using the smaller device as your video
      conference connection and your larger device (laptop or desktop)
      to follow along with the tool you will be learning about.</li>
    <li><strong>Divide your screen:</strong> If you only have one device
      and one screen, practice having two windows
      (the video conference program and one of the tools you will be using
      at the workshop) open together.
      How can you best fit both on your screen?
      Will it work better for you to toggle between them
      using a keyboard shortcut?
      Try it out in advance to decide what will work best for you.</li>
  </ul>
  This <a href="https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/06/online-workshop-logistics-and_screen-layouts/" target="_blank">blog post</a> includes detailed information on how to set up your screen to follow along during the workshop.
